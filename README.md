# Bookstore Application
**Description:** Created a GUI to emulate the process of purchasing books. There are two POV within the application that mimick the customers experience and the owners experience.

**Deployment:** When the code is run the login in screen is displayed, that is when the admin can log in and create a list of books and customer logins. In contrast the user can only access the list of books and will therefore only be able to purchase the books.
